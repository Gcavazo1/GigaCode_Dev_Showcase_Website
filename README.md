# GigaCode Developer Showcase

A cyberpunk-themed portfolio showcasing development projects, 3D models, and interactive web experiences.

## Features

- **Reactive Particle Background**: Dynamic, audio-reactive particle system that responds to music
- **Interactive 3D Models**: WebGL-powered 3D model showcase with controls
- **Audio Player**: Cyberpunk-themed music player with 3D carousel interface
- **GAN AI Generation**: Interactive AI image generation demo
- **Holographic UI**: Futuristic UI components with cyberpunk aesthetic
- **Virtual Assistant**: AI assistant with chat interface
- **Mobile and Roblox Projects**: Showcase of mobile and Roblox development work

## Audio-Reactive Particle Visualizer

The portfolio features a full-page audio-reactive particle system that responds to music playing in the audio player. The visualizer:

- Creates thousands of particles that move organically using curl noise algorithms
- Analyzes audio in real-time to extract frequency data and detect beats
- Maps different frequency bands (bass, mid, high) to visual properties like particle size, color, and movement
- Provides an immersive visual experience that complements the cyberpunk aesthetic

### Technical Implementation

The particle visualizer is implemented using:

- Three.js for efficient WebGL rendering
- GLSL shaders for high-performance particle animations
- Web Audio API for real-time audio analysis
- Curl noise algorithms for organic particle movement

## Browser Support

This portfolio is optimized for modern desktop browsers with WebGL support. For the best experience, use Chrome, Firefox, or Edge on a desktop computer.
